Description:
    This will generate a model which is notifiable, and the necessary migrations.
    If the model already exists, a migration will be created to extend the model.
    The generated model implements the Notifiable concern.

Example:
    rails generate active_record:showoff:sns:notifiable MODEL_NAME [options]

    This will create:
        app/model/MODEL_NAME.rb
        db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_showoff_sns_create_notifiable_MODEL_NAME.rb (If model is new)
        db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_showoff_sns_notifiable_to_MODEL_NAME.rb (If model exists)
