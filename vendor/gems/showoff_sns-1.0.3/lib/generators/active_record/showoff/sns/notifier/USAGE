Description:
    This will generate a model which contains a notification, and the necessary migrations.
    It will also generate an appropriate model with stubbed required methods
    The generated model inherits the Notifier base class.

Example:
    rails generate active_record:showoff:sns:notifier MODEL_NAME [options]

    This will create:
        app/model/MODEL_NAME.rb
        db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_showoff_sns_create_notifier_MODEL_NAME.rb
